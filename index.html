    <h1>Structured Programming</h1>

    <h2>Basic Logic Code:</h2>
    <p><b>Sequence</b>- First you do this, then you do that, and then finally you do this over here.</p>
    <p><b>Selection</b> - If some condition is met, do this, otherwise do that.</p>
    <p><b>Loop</b> - While this condition is true, do this.</p>



    <script>
       var myString = "I am really hungry for some";

       console.log(myString);

        //Challenge: Create a variable called myUpperString and have it capitalize your prev. string output.
       var myUpperString = myString.toUpperCase(); //Use method .toUpperCase to capitalize letters

       console.log(myUpperString);

       //Challenge 2: Pull the word "really" from the first string, and put it in its own variable, then convert it to upper case. 
       //Then make a new string and replace the lowercase "really" with the uppercase one and print it out in the console.

       var reallyLocation = myString.search('really');
       console.log(reallyLocation);  //It counted 5(which is the letter e so now we use the substr to get all 6 characters)

       var specialWord = myString.substr(reallyLocation, 6);
       console.log(specialWord);

       specialWord = specialWord.toUpperCase();
       var newString = myString.replace('really', specialWord);

       console.log(newString); //Congrats this a sequence :) 

        //Challenge 3: Make an array called foods and put four foods in the array.
        //Then use the string literal syntax to print out a sentence that prints to the console the variable myString, 
        // which was declared previously, followed by a space and then the first element of the foods array.

        var foods = ["pizza", "wings", "chocolate", "popcorn"];

        console.log(`${myString} ${foods[0]}`); //YAY! CORRECT!
        //Now see if you can loop to print out in the console one line for each statement that inclusdes the text in myString & each value in the foods array
        for(var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++){
            console.log(`${myString} ${foods[i]}`); //first through the loop i=0 will print out i am really hungry for some ___ eachitem until the length of our array (aka goig through the entire loop)
        }

        //or

        for(var eachFood of foods){
            console.log(`${myString} ${eachFood}`);//for..loop example
        }

        //Challenge 4: Modify the script so that this time if the index of food is an even number, convert it to uppercase, otherwise don't convert it. 
        /* for(var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++){

            var remainder = i % 2;

            if(remainder === 0){
                var foodUpper = foods[i].toUpperCase();
                console.log(`${myString} ${foodUpper}`); 
            }
            else {
                console.log(`${myString} ${foods[i]}`);
            }
   
        } */
       
        //Refactoring Code  -the process of making your code simpler. (From the Solution Above)
        for(var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++){
                if(i % 2 === 0){   //check if the incrementor is even 
                    console.log(`${myString} ${foods[i].toUpperCase()}`); //if even = UPPERCASE
                }
                else {
                    console.log(`${myString} ${foods[i]}`);//otherwise it is odd/lowercased
                }
            }
